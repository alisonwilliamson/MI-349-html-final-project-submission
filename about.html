                <p>Since 2018 Ekcel provides the good feeling of security worldwide. As a American quality manufacturer we ensure that our products are highly reliable and offer a long service life while being easy to operate.</p>
                <h2>OUR CAUSE </h2>
                <p>At Ekcel we believe in doing well by doing good. That is why we â€“ by growing our and building our brand- support different causes that nurture the love and spread the benefits of cycling. One of our causes can be found below:</p>
                <h3>WORLD BICYCLE RELIEF</h3>
                <p>World Bicycle Relief mobilizes people through The Power of Bicycles. This initiative is committed to helping people conquer the challenge of distance, achieve independence and thrive.

                        For many people in rural regions of developing countries, poverty is a daily reality. In areas where walking is the only mode of transport, a Buffalo Bicycle offers the real and immediate benefit of reliable access to essential goods and services. Powered by the remarkable human spirit, bicycles are a catalyst to possibilities.
                        
                        Their innovative model, combining philanthropic distributions with social enterprise sales, is the backbone on which they deliver greater efficiencies of scale, distribute more bicycles per donation and generate deeper impact where we work.
                        
                        Ekcel donates yearly 1% of our profit to World Bicycle Relief to support our mission and enable life-changing mobility. </p>
